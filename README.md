#  Simple Weather API Docs

This project contains detailed documentation for a Simple Weather API that allows developers to fetch real-time weather information based on city or location input. It is designed to help developers understand how to use the API effectively, including endpoint structure, request parameters, and expected responses.

##  Overview

The Simple Weather API provides the following data:
- Current weather conditions
- Temperature (in Celsius and Fahrenheit)
- Humidity
- Wind speed
- Weather descriptions (e.g., Cloudy, Sunny, Rainy)
